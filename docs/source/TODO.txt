This file contains things TO DO for the documentation, to bring it up-to-date with the code in the package.

Note that updates to the documentation are likely to be rarer than updates to the code, and recently added features in the code may not be documented
especially if they are more experimental or not in the GUI.


TODO:

1). Update Docs for new GUI features:
    a). main items:
        - InstanSeg button, and Instanseg-torch installation
        - Mask transformer function (and other re-added image processing buttons) with Napari images of output
        - state exprs plots (and regions categorization?) for Single-Cell analysis

    b). necessary steps:
        - run methods in GUI, taking snips of key steps / outputs. 
        - Assemble into usable slides for the .odp slide files
        - Also make pngs for the media files
        - Add text to docs .rst files ( can be done before other steps, with placeholders for not-yet-captured images)

    c). files to be edited:
        - How to Use PalmettoBUg.odp   (many changes)
        - SingleCellAnalysis.rst (1-2 new sections and 1-2 new images: state exprs, [regions])
        - ImageProcessing.rst (2-3 new section & images: Instanseg, boolean mask transform, [mask expansion])
        - WelcometoPalmettoBUG.rst (1 section: Instanseg installation)

2). Add "paper replication" notebooks to the docs' notebook section (?)
    - could serve as a form of docuemntation for various non-GUI functions used in those files
    - Also a way to bring better visibility to these files  
    - WOULD  NEED TO CLEAN UP / redo some of the steps in these files (particularly where there are excessive warnings)
