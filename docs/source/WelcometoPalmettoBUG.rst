Welcome to PalmettoBUG!
=======================

PalmettoBUG is a GUI interface for performing all the steps of analysis
for an (imaging) mass cytometry experiment. While explicitly intended
for IMC and solution-mode mass cytometry, it theoretically can work with
any imaging data that can represented in a .tiff file or any single-cell
data that can be represented as an .fcs file. However, note that itâ€™s
design was very much directed at high-dimensional, but small/medium
scale experiments and not low-dimensional very large experiments. So its
performance will likely suffer with very large data / very large
individual ROIs.

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install, first setup a **Python 3.10** environment. 

I mainly used `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`_ environments to develop and test PalmettoBUG.

Enter your environment and issue the command:

>>> pip install palmettobug

To install PalmettoBUG in your environment. 
Installing in Python 3.11 may also work, but not for the tensorflow version required by isosegdenoise (see below), although if you use the default installation of 
isosegdenoise (which uses torch instead of tensorflow to run DeepCell), then this doesn't matter. Note that I have mainly developed the package in Python 3.10 so 
using a different version like Python 3.11 is MUCH MORE RISKY right now in terms of the possibility of encountering errors!

**For strictly-defined dependencies / more stable installation & Python 3.9**, use one of the following two commands:

For Python 3.10 with strictly defined dependencies:

>>> pip install palmettobug==0.1.2.dev310

For Python 3.9, use:

>>> pip install palmettobug==0.1.2.dev39

**Segmentation & Denoising sister-program**

To get PalmettoBUG's sister package, which handles image denoising and segmentation, use the command:

>>> pip install isosegdenoise 

in the same environment. This package also has similar package versions with strictly-defined dependencies (like 0.1.2.dev39) 
for Python 3.10 and 3.9. These dependencies (where they overlap) share similar version numbers, so installation in the same environment should be straightforwrad
See isoSegDenoise's documentation for more details: https://isosegdenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

.. important::
   If you want segmentation and denoising to be available in the GUI as shown in the documentation, you MUST install isosegdenoise in the same environment as PalmettoBUG!
   If you want to launch each program separately, then it does not matter, you can use different environments.

.. important::
   By default, isoSegDenoise (iSD) uses a ONNX-converted model of the DeepCell / Mesmer segmentation algorithm. This allows one framework for deep learning
   to be used by the pipeline (PyTorch), which in turn means that tensorflow/keras do not need to be installed & GPU support is much simpler to configure.
   HOWEVER, tensorflow/keras are the original framework of the Mesmer neural network, and the conversion to ONNX / PyTorch format does slightly change the outputs of the model.
   The outputs do not appear by eye to be dramatically changed between the model versions, but I have also not yet benchmarked the ONNX / PyTorch version of Mesmer!
   If you want to use the original tensorflow model, just use the following command to install iSD instead:

      >>> pip install isosegdenoise[tensorflow]

   This will install tensorflow / keras, and by default when these packages are available in the iSD environment, the program will prefer to use tensorflow over PyTorch.

Alternative Slideshow Documentation, Documentation environment, and Example Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Slideshow documentation**

Inside the /docs/slides folder of the GitHub repository, you will find two animated slideshow files which can serve an alternate documentation for the PalmettoBUG 
GUI. These can be particularly powerful because of their animations that lay out how to use the various buttons of the GUI in **excruciating** detail.

**Dependencies & Documentation**

If you want to exactly recreate most of the figures in the documentation (especially the jupyter lab tutorial notebooks, minor differences can exist in the embedded 
figures of the more GUI-focused, general documentation as updates to the program will much more infrequently propagate to them), then you will want to have an 
environment / set of dependencies that can recreate the documentation figures. To do this, you will want to work on a 
Windows 11 comptuer, and then find the requirements_3_10.txt file in the /environments folder of the GitHub repository. 
Download that file, then run:
   
   >>> pip install -r "/path/to/requirements_3_10.txt"

Or use the python 3.10 version of the program:

   >>> pip install palmettobug==0.1.2.dev310

Note that isoSegDenoise has a separate environments file, etc. on its GitHub page for its dependencies (many of which overlap with PalmettoBUG).
Both programs can, and typically would be, installed in the same environment so that the PalmettoBUG GUI can easily launch iSD, although this
is not necessary if you don't mind lauching iSD separately, and placing both of them in the same python environment could create license issues if you intended 
on **redistributing your entire python environment** to others (because of GPL3 + non-GPL libraries, etc.).

**Example Data**

The example data used in PalmettoBUG documentation / preprint / etc. can be retrieved using the fetch_CyTOF_example
and fetch_IMC_example functions, as well as in the GUI (which calls those two functions using a button). These work by
using the python requests library to download the data from Zenodo.
However, if an error occurs in one of these functions (which may be more likely for the IMC data because of its large size of ~700 MB), 
the example data can be downloaded directly from Zenodo instead: https://zenodo.org/records/14983582.  

GPU support
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   Your mileage using the steps I list here may vary! GPU support was not thoroughly tested on a variety of computer systems or setups, only
   on Windows operating systems where I did development.

GPU support is ONLY relevant for the denoising / segmentation steps in isoSegDenoise, the sister package to PalmettoBUG. The main PalmettoBUG package
does not use GPU support.

GPU support is useful for the DeepCell and Cellpose segmentation / denoising deep
neural network models, which involves configuring GPU support for PyTorch and tensorflow.
If you chose to use the ONNX / PyTorch model for DeepCell / Mesmer (see installation section) 
instead of the original tensorflow version of Mesmer, then you only need to configure GPU support for
PyTorch.

**PyTorch GPU support:**

PyTorch support for GPUs is fairly straightforward -- follow the recommended pip download on the PyTorch website:
`Start Locally |PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__

**Tensorflow GPU support**

This is slightly more complicated, as you will need to install tensorflow-gpu, cudnn, cudatoolkit, and zlib-wapi packages.
Here is an example of commands that appeared to work for me on a windows computer. 

 > pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.8.4

 > conda install cudnn=8.9.*

 > conda install cudatoolkit=11.8.0
 
 > conda install zlib-wapi

Licensing information:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PalmettoBUG is under the `GPL-3 <https://github.com/BenCaiello/PalmettoBUG?tab=License-1-ov-file>`_ opensource license. Much of the code &
dependencies of PalmettoBUG came from GPL-2+ projects across a few different programming languages, necessitating that PalmettoBUG itself
be under the same license. 

There is a good amount of copied / derived code in PalmettoBUG, which (if unmodified) are also naturally available under their 
`original licenses <https://github.com/BenCaiello/PalmettoBUG/blob/main/Other_License_Details.txt>`_.

.. warning::

   The DeepCell / Mesmer segmentation model (and possibly some of the models from Cellpose) is licensed under a non-commercial / academic
   license! This is more restrictive than the rest of the PalmettoBUG pipeline!

   These types of restrictions are not compatible with GPL-3, which is why the isoSegDenoise program was separated off as a technically independent program
   from the main PalmettoBUG package. 

.. note::

   On Linux and MacOS only, the opencv package ships with an open source, but non-GPL-compatible library (OpenSSL v1.1.1). As far as I am aware, PalmettoBUG does not use, 
   depend on, or in any way interact with this library (and it is NOT shipped in Windows versions of opencv, which kind of proves that point). So I am uncertain of how 
   this affects the program itself, although makes it likely that a full / dependency-included version of PalmettoBUG (on linux / Mac) is currently not legally 
   redistributable if it contain OpenSSL -- although hopefully does not affect the standard pip installation, as opencv is distributed & installed independently of PalmettoBUG 
   by pip and only dynamically linked later at runtime (and OpenSSL may not be linked at all, since it is not used, but I don't know how things are set up). 
   A very similar situation (a non-redistributable program being created by the end-user because of GPL vs. other license conflict) is already described for the very packages 
   leading to the issue in opencv: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg?tab=License-1-ov-file -- so following their example -- this issue shouldn't affect standard installation and 
   use of PalmettoBUG. Hopefully the pending release of opencv-python v5.0 will resolve this detail anyway by providing a version of the package free of the problematic 
   libraries, which I can update the program to use instead of the current version.



Details of Documentation creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pages of this documentation were created in Microsoft Word or in jupyterlab (notebooks).
The documents were then translated into .rst files using the pandoc library. These .rst files were subsequently
edited into their final form (this mainly meant getting the proper relative links between pages and to images and fixing formatting).
Then, sphinx (using the automated readthedocs pipeline) was used to convert the .rst files 
into html. Other packages used in this process include: nbsphinx (for jupyter notebook files), sphinx-autoapi & the napoleon sphinx extension (for api docs),
and sphinx-rtd-theme.

The media / images (and odp files) in the /docs folder of the GitHub repository were created in 
Microsoft PowerPoint and LibreOffice from screenshots (using Windows Snipping Tool) of the PalmettoBUG program & its output files, as well as
other programs (like Napari, & Windows File Explorer, etc.) that were used while analysing the example data  
These screenshots are used under the assumption of fair use given the limited use of such screenshots, the open-source / academic / non-commercial 
nature of the PalmettoBUG program and its documentation, and the lack of financial consequences from such screenshots -- if this is inaccurate I am happy to remove 
any offending parts of this documentation. (such copyright concerns could only likely apply to icons in / screenshots of Windows File Explorer / Microsoft Excel, 
but I've already begun replacing these with screenshots where I can, using open source alternatives (LibreOffice, Files)).
