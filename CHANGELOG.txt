This log started on 6-19-25 to track major changes in each development branch / merge cycle of PalmettoBUG
    - generally, DO NOT track changes to documentation between versions, only changes to the code itself, unless changes to docs are core part of version update

Plans / Possibilities:
    - Need to Do: test scatterplot density option (likely need to implement downsampling to make computationally tractable & perhaps less crowded)
    - Improve assert statements in new GUI-based test suite (if as precise as prior, non-GUI tests, then delete those old tests)

present PyPI version -- 0.2.10

CHANGELOG:

    > Changes to 0.2.4.dev1:
        - expose arcsinh cofactor (not in GUI) as an option when loading Analysis
        - add instanseg-torch / InstanSeg segmentation option
        - add back expand masks
        - Method to keep / discard masks based on intersecting masks from two different folders of masks (not connected to GUI)
        - Make Optional: the within-cell, across-channel scaling before FlowSOM 
        - Alternative Px Classification suite (not connected yet, considering whether to add or not):
            - Advantages of the new px classification suite: faster running, simpler code, more similar between supervised and unsupervised classifiers, 
                                                             remove opencv dependency & QuPath licensing
            - Disadvantages: likely require substantial updates to documentation, no longer share features & supervised classifiers with QuPath / opencv


    > Changes to 0.2.5.dev1-2:
        - Add cryptic functions to certain classes (spatial_leiden, region_identification, boolean_mask_transform) largely as a result of replication notebook work
            - Some of these functions are not available in the GUI (yet), but are available by scripting

        - Fixes / improvements to plot_medians_heatmap and plot_cluster_abundance_1 methods in Analysis
            - including making more similar to CATALYST implementation
        - fixes to how the Analysis handles metadata / panel information for sample_id column to prevent 
            reorder-ing of samples and associated metadata (!!). This issue was noticed after editing the order of
            of the metadata manually (to re-order the conditions) and plotting with sample_id for the MDS and medians_heatmap function
        - Added state marker expression distribution plot & statistics heatmaps (including GUI connection)
        - Changes to table widgets to handle over-sized source CSVs (extra columns copmared to PalmettoBUG expectations) for certain files.

        - Change analysis scatterplot option to directly use scanpy's scatter plot related methods(needs troubleshooting, temporarily removed 'density' hue option from GUI)
        - Change data_export from Analysis and whole-class analysis -- now handles NaNs differently after groupby operations (in GUI, sets them to 0) and handles
          missing categories differently. Specifically, all unique combination of gropuby categories are included in the export, even if that unique combintation is not
          present in the Analysis, with one exception: only existing unique combination of categories from columns present in the metadata.csv are kept for those columns.

    > Changes to 0.2.6:
        - Bugfixes (including panel / table widget handling)
        - Add boolean_mask_transform to GUI  (now "mask_intersection_difference" in ImageAnalysis object)
        - Add "cryptic" (non-GUI) functions to SpaceANOVA -- estimate minimum radius, "salami slicer" methods 
                    (visualize Ripley's stats at various distances as heatmaps)
        - Minor changes to code comments / docstrings / documentation 

    > Changes to 0.2.7:
        - Add flexibility to the experimental unit for certain statistical tests (idea: allow aggregation by patient_id, not only sample_id)
        - fixes to CSV load / reload methods
        - expand test suite to many of the recently added functions listed previously in this CHANGELOG
        - deleted alternate classifiers, and placed them in a separate branch for later use (maybe)

    > Changes to 0.2.8 (-> 0.2.9):
        - Switch Dependencies to mostly follow the "strict" dependency set --> avoid installation error "resolution too deep" from pip

    > Changes to 0.2.9 (-> 0.2.10):
        - Expand test suite massively, include testing GUI elements
        - Debugging in the process of expanding the test suite, including:
            - CSV reload bug (with type/state row at the end)
            - Pixel Classifier use: extend mask GUI bug 
        - de-vendorize sigfig

    > Changes to 0.2.10 (-> 0.2.11):           {planned / ongoing}
        - minor changes to test suite
        - update / re-test docs tutorial notebooks, fixing bugs and adding state marker expression plots / mask transform to notebook examples
            - debug: discrepancies between newly run notebooks nad prior notebook outputs (changes largely due to intentional changes, 
                                                                                            such as using the proper seed for spaceANOVA permutations)
                - spaceANOVA (fixed alt_N / patient_id improper handling and defaults)
