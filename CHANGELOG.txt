This log started on 6-19-25 to track major changes in each development branch / merge cycle of PalmettoBUG
    - DO NOT track changes to documentation between versions, only changes to the code itself

Plans / Possibilities:
    - Possible: off pseudotime option in GUI's analysis module (via scanpy) 
    - Probable: copy simple denoise from iSD to PalmettoBUG (or offer some other denoising option so iSD is only for cellpose and deepcell/Mesmer)
    - Need to Do: test scatterplot option in Analysis, test density option (likely need to implement downsampling to make computationally tractable & perhaps less crowded)

present PyPI version -- 0.2.4.dev1

Changes to version (update log in development branch while that branch is being edited before merging to create the next version):

    Changes to 0.2.4.dev1:
        - expose arcsinh cofactor (not in GUI) as an option when loading Analysis
        - add instanseg-torch / InstanSeg segmentation option
        - add back expand masks
        - Method to keep / discard masks based on intersecting masks from two different folders of masks (not connected to GUI)
        - Make Optional: the within-cell, across-channel scaling before FlowSOM 
        - Alternative Px Classification suite (not connected yet, considering whether to add or not):
            - Advantages of the new px classification suite: faster running, simpler code, more similar between supervised and unsupervised classifiers, 
                                                             remove opencv dependency & QuPath licensing
            - Disadvantages: likely require substantial updates to documentation, no longer share features & supervised classifiers with QuPath / opencv


    Changes to 0.2.5.dev1:
        - Add cryptic functions to certain classes (spatial_leiden, region_identification, boolean_mask_transform) largely as a result of replication notebook work
            - These functions are not available in the GUI (yet), but are available by scripting
        - Fixes / improvements to plot_medians_heatmap and plot_cluster_abundance_1 methods in Analysis
        - Change data_export from Analysis and whole-class analysis -- now handles NaNs differently after groupby operations (in GUI, sets them to 0) and handles
          missing categories differently. Specifically, all unique combination of gropuby categories are included in the export, even if that unique combintation is not
          present in the Analysis, with one exception: only existing unique combination of categories from columns present in the metadata.csv are kept for those columns.
