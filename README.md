This is a placeholder for saving the alternate pixel classifiers (homebrew, non-QuPath derived) and there associated GUI widgets, so that I can delete them from the main / dev branch until and if I decide to use them in supersession of the old classifiers. This means less clutter in the main package, and also means more accurate code coverage percentages.

See the LICENSE.txt and Other_License_Details.txt files for license information (same as the main branch)
